Toolbox Assignment Week4 #2
* When saving a file, be sure to add the .md extention after the file name to make it into a markdown file.  If not, it will be a plain test file.
* Forking a repository means copying it to your own account bu clocking the Fork icon on the top right.  It will be a separate repo in your account, marked by a fork icon (looks like an upside down Y).
* Issuing a Pull rquest on a forked repo is usually done after making changes to the repo.  It means I am asking the pther user to pull the repo out of my account to his or her account.
* Is there a way to organize repo's in folders? This can get out of hand quite quickly.
